# GNCIPL_Projects
GNCIPL AI/ML Internship – Weekly Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository for the AI/ML Internship at GNCIPL.
This repository contains all weekly assignments completed during the internship, covering Machine Learning, Data Analysis, EDA, and Predictive Modeling.

Each week includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and the dataset used for the project.

# 📅 Weekly Project Overview
## 📌 Week 1 – Bank Loan Approval Prediction

Project File: Bank_Loan_Approval Project.ipynb

Dataset: loan_data.csv

Description:
Developed a classification model using ML algorithms to predict loan approval status for applicants based on financial and personal parameters.

## 📌 Week 2 – Mental Health Analysis in IT Sector

Project File: Mental_Health_IT .ipynb

Dataset: survey.csv

Description:
Conducted EDA and visualization to understand mental health patterns among IT employees and factors affecting mental well-being.

## 📌 Week 3 – Mall Customer Segmentation

Project File: Mall_customer_dataset_week3.ipynb

Dataset: Mall_Customers.csv

Description:
Performed customer segmentation using K-Means clustering to analyze shopping patterns and identify target customer groups.

## 📌 Week 4 – Hotel Demand Analysis

Project File: Hotel_demand_week4.ipynb

Dataset: Row Data.xlsx

Description:
Explored hotel booking datasets, analyzed booking patterns, seasonal trends, cancellations, and customer categories.

## 📌 Week 5 – Mobile Price Prediction

Project File: Mobile_price_prediction_week5.ipynb

Dataset: mobile phone price prediction.csv

Description:
Developed Neural Network–based models (Single Layer Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and Artificial Neural Network) to predict mobile phone prices using key features such as RAM, camera quality, storage capacity, and battery power. Implemented these models using TensorFlow/Keras to achieve accurate and reliable price predictions.
