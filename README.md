# GNCIPL_Projects
GNCIPL AI/ML Internship – Weekly Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository for the AI/ML Internship at GNCIPL.
This repository contains all weekly assignments completed during the internship, covering Machine Learning, Data Analysis, EDA, and Predictive Modeling.

Each week includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and the dataset used for the project.

# 📅 Weekly Project Overview
## 📌 Week 1 – Bank Loan Approval Prediction

Project File: Bank_Loan_Approval Project.ipynb

Dataset: loan_data.csv

Description:
Built a machine learning classification model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The model uses financial and personal features such as income, credit score, employment experience, loan amount, and past loan history to analyze approval patterns and make predictions.

## 📌 Week 2 – Mental Health Analysis in IT Sector

Project File: Mental_Health_IT .ipynb

Dataset: survey.csv

Description:
Performed exploratory data analysis on a mental health survey of IT professionals by cleaning data, visualizing trends, and identifying key factors influencing treatment-seeking behavior using Python.

## 📌 Week 3 – Mall Customer Segmentation

Project File: Mall_customer_dataset_week3.ipynb

Dataset: Mall_Customers.csv

Description:
This project performs customer segmentation using the Mall Customers dataset by applying K-Means clustering on annual income and spending score to identify distinct customer groups for targeted marketing.

## 📌 Week 4 – Hotel Demand Analysis

Project File: Hotel_demand_week4.ipynb

Dataset: Row Data.xlsx

Description:
Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing on hotel booking data to analyze booking behavior, cancellations, and seasonal trends. Implemented feature engineering, normalization, PCA, and K-Means clustering to create guest personas and evaluate cluster quality.

## 📌 Week 5 – Mobile Price Prediction

Project File: Mobile_price_prediction_week5.ipynb

Dataset: mobile phone price prediction.csv

Description:
Built a mobile price prediction model using neural networks (SLP, MLP, ANN) with TensorFlow to classify phones as low or high price based on their specifications.

📌 About the Internship

During my internship at GNCIPL, I worked on real datasets to strengthen my understanding of:

Exploratory Data Analysis

Supervised & Unsupervised ML

Real-world data preprocessing

Predictive modeling and interpretation

This repository reflects my weekly learning journey and hands-on practice.
